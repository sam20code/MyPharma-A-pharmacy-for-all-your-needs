# MyPharma-A-pharmacy-for-all-your-needs
We designed a system by using an object oriented paradigm where all the
medical stores are present on the single platform. We have implemented this by
forming several classes, each of them working is explained below. Basically we
try to buit a real and user friendly application. The In this We have implemented
an actionListner interface so that we can perform certain actions when clicking
the buttons and design the action by overriding the actionPerformed method of
actionListener interface. Inorder to design the panel and setting background
images adjusted with margin we used swing library in java by importing
javax.swing.* .We have used sql as well so that we can store the entered entries
by including jar files which works as a jdbc driver.
